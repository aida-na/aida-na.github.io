i build products and communities where technology meets human flourishing.

currently building in AI for education and health, grounded in a decade of product work and research in microelectronics and in AI. i've commercialized research twice, shipped products to 30M+ users.

i've spent equal time building infrastructure for others: led MIT's Brazil incubator, established hackathons and accelerators in Kazakhstan, brought startup ecosystems to underserved regions.

the pattern: notice what's missing, build the bridge, empower others to cross it. the work is as much about wellbeing and community as it is about code and metrics.
